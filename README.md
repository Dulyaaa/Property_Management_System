# 🏡 Property Management System

This is a group project for 2nd Year 1st Semester - Object Oriented Programming (OOP) module, where we have to build a Property Management System according to the OOP concept. 

## About

This is a  simple efficient system. Here we try to solve the difficulties faced in when the people find the best property they need and manage them. Mainly in this project we have considered the properties as Houses, Lands, Apartments, and Ideal Home (which has provided the services to manage the properties). As a solution we develop a Web application where the website administrator and user can use whenever they need.

### 🛠 My contribution to the project was:
* User account where user can update user details, create ad and view
* Login and Logout operations with sessions
* Admin could add new Ideal Home(Service)
* Admin could View, Update, and delete all Ideal Home
* Display all Ideal Home
